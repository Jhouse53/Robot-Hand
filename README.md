### Version 2
Version 2 was the first version that we worked with and attempted to print out. One of the main problems with this design was that it was to small and it didn't print well.

### Version 3
Version 3 was the updated version of version 2 we only focused on the fingers for version 3 and made some changes. The most important changes we made were changes to the width of the finger and the addition of some indentations that were suppose to be used to attach string to.

### Version 3.2
Version 3.2 is similar to Version 3 in most ways aside from a couple of differences. One being the new hand that was created along with the updated hands and some small updates to the fingers such as an increase to the length of the finger and the addition of another set of indentations on the back of the finger.
